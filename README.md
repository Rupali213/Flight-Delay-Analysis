# Flight Delay Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Key aspects of the analysis include:

- **Dataset Overview**: Summary and structure of the dataset
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Handling incomplete or missing data
- **Delay Cause Breakdown**: By carrier, weather, NAS, security, late aircraft
- **Time-Based Patterns**: Trends across years and months
- **Top Airports & Airlines**: Based on delay frequency and types
- **Interactive Visuals**: With Plotly for enhanced insights

## Key Insights

- **Carrier delays** are the most common type of delay.
- **Late aircraft** issues often lead to cascading delays.
- Seasonal spikes in delays, especially during winter and summer holidays.
- Some airports consistently show higher delay percentages.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas / NumPy** â€“ Data handling
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** â€“ Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
